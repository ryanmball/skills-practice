# Write a function that takes in two arrays of numbers and returns all the numbers that appear in both arrays.

# Function with loop to print each number in the first array

# Function with loop to print each number in the second array

# Function to loop through the first array and check to check what numbers appear in both arrays



# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the 3rd largest number.

# Clarify
# Can we use methods??
input: numbers = [2, 3, 5, 23, 67]
output: 5

# Visualize

# Decomposition
# Function to sort the array in descending order and print the array
# Function to sort the array in descending order and print the element at index 2, this would be the 3rd largest number


# Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns all the pairs of strings that have a total length of 8 characters.

# Clarify
# Does total length mean the length of two strings combined equals 8?
# Should the pairs be two separate strings in an array or a combined string?
input: string = ["five", "four", "three", "eight", "few", "two", "wildcard"]
output: pairs = [["five", "four"], ["three", "few"], ["three", "two"], ["eight", "few"], ["eight", "two"]]
